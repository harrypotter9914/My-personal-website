            <p>
                Hi there! I’m Yibo Wang, a <span class="highlight">game designer and developer</span> who bridges <span class="highlight">game design and technical implementation</span> to create <span class="highlight">immersive experiences</span>.
				<br><br>
				I craft unique <span class="highlight">game mechanics and narratives</span> as a designer, while also <span class="highlight">building the systems</span> that bring them to life as a programmer—from <span class="highlight">Unity-based</span> 2D platformers to <span class="highlight">Unreal Engine-powered</span> emotional driving simulators.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not coding or sketching level layouts, you’ll find me <span class="highlight">flying drones</span> to capture landscapes that <span class="highlight">inspire</span> my game worlds, or <span class="highlight">collaborating</span> with others—whether <span class="highlight">teaching science</span> through interactive games or co-developing AI tools with international peers at Oxford’s summer program.
                <br><br>
                I believe the <span class="highlight">best games</span> are born from <span class="highlight">teamwork and diverse perspectives</span>, Let’s make magic together!
